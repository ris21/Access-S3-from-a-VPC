# Access-S3-from-a-VPC
I created this project to demonstrate how to securely access an Amazon S3 bucket from an EC2 instance within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. 
I was able to create and configure a VPC, launch an EC2 instance, configure security groups, create S3 bucket, use IAM to create access keys, and finally use the AWS CLI to interact with S3 bucket. 
By implementing this hands-on project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of networking, security, and cloud storage integration on AWS.

## Project Objectives
1. Create and configure a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets and security groups.
2. Launch an EC2 instance within the VPC and configure access via SSH port 22.
3. Set up IAM roles to allow secure access to S3 from the EC2 instance.
4. Access and upload files from an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.

## Skills Gained
1. VPC Setup: Created and configured VPCs, subnets, route tables, and Internet Gateways.
2. EC2 Configuration: Launched EC2 instances and configured security groups for controlled access.
3. Security Best Practices: Managed IAM roles and permissions to provide EC2 instances secure access to AWS services.
4. AWS CLI Usage: Learned to interact with AWS services like S3 from an EC2 instance using the command line.
5. Networking: Understood the concepts of private and public subnets, and routing traffic within a VPC.
6. Cloud Storage: Accessed and manipulated objects in S3 buckets using programmatic access (CLI) from an EC2 instance.
